Data Science Specialization Capstone Project

This repository contains the user interface files in order to predict the next probable word given a sequence of words.

The ```ui.R``` file provides the user interface front-end characteristics and the ```server.R``` contains the processing methods.

The historical data used for the predictions are available at the file ```tdmNgram.RData``` and the next word prediction is available at the file ```predWord.R```

The necessary libraries to run the code are:
- ```shiny```
- ```tm```
